# The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator
A practical CPU scheduling simulation tool with real-time visualization with heuristic suggestions and TestBased conclusions for various scheduling algorithms, With given implementation, to train AI/ML or prediction models, using Large-Sample-Tests methods provided in the simulator  

## Overview
This project is a CPU scheduling simulator that helps visualize and analyze different scheduling algorithms. It currently supports:

### Implemented:  
Process Scheduling using following algorithms  
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS) -NP  
2. Shortest Job First (SJF) -NP  
3. Round Robin (RR) -P  
4. Priority Scheduling -NP 
5. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) -P  
Non-preemptive -NP && Preemptive -P  

### Planned Enhancements:
+ Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)  
+ Adding AI/ML training { on existing DataGenerating Methods} for dynamic scheduling [ and better suggestions to user]  
+ Advanced heuristics parameters than existings ones  
+ More interactive GUI features for user-friendly simulations  

### Features
+ Gantt Chart Visualization (Both preemptive and Non-preemptive)  
+ Multiple Scheduling Algorithms (fcfs,sjf,srtf,rr,priority)  
+ Performance Metrics (Avg. Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, Response Times)  
+ Testing Programs for Algorithms (For large Sample data testing)
+ Population and Sample Data implementations to train AI/ML prediction models
