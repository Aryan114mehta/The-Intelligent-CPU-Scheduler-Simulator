1. Project Overview
The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator aims to provide an interactive and visual tool for understanding and analyzing CPU scheduling algorithms. Users can input process details such as arrival time, burst time, and priority, and the simulator will generate real-time visualizations of scheduling decisions, including Gantt charts and performance metrics (waiting time, turnaround time, response time).

Expected Outcomes
Interactive Simulator: Users can test different scheduling algorithms.
Visual Representation: Real-time Gantt charts and performance metrics.
Comparative Analysis: Users can compare different algorithms based on efficiency.
User-Friendly GUI: Easy-to-use interface for adding/modifying processes.
Scope
Supports FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.
Real-time process execution simulation.
Performance metrics calculation.
Graphical visualization of scheduling behavior.
2. Module-Wise Breakdown
To implement the simulator efficiently, we divide it into three main modules:

Module 1: Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Purpose: Provide an interface for users to input process details and view scheduling results.

Roles:

Accept user input (arrival time, burst time, priority, quantum for RR).
Display results dynamically using graphs and tables.
Allow algorithm selection and comparison.
Example Features:

Input Panel: Text fields for process data.
Start Simulation Button: Triggers scheduling execution.
Algorithm Selector: Dropdown menu to choose an algorithm.
Gantt Chart Display: Visual representation of process execution.
Module 2: Scheduling Algorithms Processing
Purpose: Implement CPU scheduling algorithms to compute process execution sequences.

Roles:

Compute process scheduling order based on selected algorithm.
Calculate metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.
Example Features:

First Come First Serve (FCFS): Execute processes in order of arrival.
Shortest Job First (SJF): Execute the shortest process first.
Round Robin (RR): Implement time slicing.
Priority Scheduling: Execute processes based on priority.
Module 3: Data Visualization & Analytics
Purpose: Generate graphical output for Gantt charts and performance metrics.

Roles:

Visualize Gantt charts using libraries like Matplotlib.
Display comparative bar charts for waiting time and turnaround time.
Enable real-time animations of the scheduling process.
Example Features:

Gantt Chart Representation: Show execution order.
Bar Chart for Performance Metrics: Compare algorithms.
Table View: Show numerical data for easy analysis.
